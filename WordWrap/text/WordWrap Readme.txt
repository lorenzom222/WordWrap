The status of my program is complete, however it is unable to print blank spaces between each spaces. My first while loop takes in the users input, read it by line, and will stop reading once it read a sing “Stop.” on a line. The paragraph+=line + “\n” is essential to our code as after it finishes reading each line, it will create a newline after to format it as a paragraph rather than one single line This is our "rough draft”.  Before our second while loop, I created a second scanner to read the “rough draft”. The second while loop read the “rough draft” string by string rather than line, and this time will limit each to a specific character count the user inputs at the beginning of the code. EX. “30.” will make limit char count 30 characters per line. The newparagraph+=newline+”\n” also creates a string has exceeded the character limit. Finally it will print our entire paragraph without the blank spaces in between paragraphs I was able to use the blankLine() to produce the blanks, however by making each line a string it would have created an overflow in the character count for each line. Because of that bug, I decided to neglect the blank lines between paragraphs and remove the code for simplicity of the code.
